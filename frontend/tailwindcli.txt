(https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli)
should work according to subject but at least as a temporary solution :)

1) npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
2) write '@import "tailwindcss";' into temporary input.css file
3) npx @tailwindcss/cli -i input.css -o [OUTPUTFILE] --watch
4) add [OUTPUTFILE] as stylesheet

input.css no longer needed
use tailwind.config.js to reduce output file size to minimum
